# Summary

The Open Systems Thinking curriculum is a **complete education in systems thinking**, focusing on tackling complex global challenges such as poly- and metacrises. 

This courseware is for individuals who want to:
- Gain a solid understanding of systems thinking principles and tools.
- Learn to analyze and address global and systemic challenges.
- Build practical skills for modeling, mapping, and solving complex problems.

### Organization
The curriculum is divided as follows:
- **Introduction to Systems Thinking**: Basics of systems thinking, its importance, and foundational concepts.
- **Theoretical Foundations**: Key theories such as feedback loops, causal systems, and dynamic modeling.
- **Practical Tools**: Hands-on tools for mapping, scenario planning, and simulations.
- **Case Studies**: Application of systems thinking to real-world challenges like climate change and global health.
- **Central Resources**: A library of books, tools, videos, and articles to support your learning.
